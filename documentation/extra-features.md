# Noire Extra Features


## F12 Spymode
This bind removed in Ring Racers has been brought back.

## addfilelocal
Allows players to run local addons such as player skins with local skin, graphic replacements, or simple lua scripts for things such as custom HUDs.

## localskin
When a skin is added with either addfilelocal or regular addfile it can be applied visually without affecting your acutal character. For example you can use Sonic's skin over Tails on your end while everyone else sees you as Tails.
