# Noire Mapheader Additions

## LegacyStart
When this is put into a mapheader, the map will instead start with a SRB2Kart style race start instead of position.

## LegacyBoxScale
When this is put into a mapheader, itemboxes will be the same size as they were in SRB2Kart.

## Terrain
This can be used to turn off Terrain on maps. Mostly useful for binary maps.

## LegacyNoPhysics
This restores the no physics flag on sectors not allowing launching.
