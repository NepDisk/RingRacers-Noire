# Ring Racers Noire Map information.
The game can now load and play binary maps again along with support for SRB2Kart's checkpoints and sector specials.

Not everything will work here and maps will have to be edited. Ports to UDMF are highly recommended since the addition of HWR2 later in Ring Racers life will more then likely break binary map support due to the need of GLNodes.
